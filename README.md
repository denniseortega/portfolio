## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Web browser_
* _HTML and CSS_
* _denniseortega.github.io/portfolio_

_This project only uses HTML and CSS._

## Known Bugs

_I had trouble successfully viewing my live GitHub Pages site. I believe I was committing changes in the gh-pages branch instead of the master branch. I thought that  deleting my repository in Github would help, but I learned that I had to delete my repository locally by using rm -rf .git in order for that to work. I wonder if there is a more efficient way to do/if there was a different problem._
